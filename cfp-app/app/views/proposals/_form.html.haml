      This <em>optional</em> video will NOT be seen in the blind review phase
      (though in the second phase, it may help break ties. The intent is for
      this to be fun and light, <em>not</em> high pressure. You in front of a
      laptop using Photo Booth is the idea, <em>not</em> you spending too much
      time on video editing and script writing. It WILL be made public if your
      talk is accepted. We'll use these to help market your talk and EmberConf
      to the public once we announce the agenda, so feel free to be
      faux-presumptuous. Speak as though you've already been accepted and are
      giving your audience a sneak peak. 1:30 max length please.
