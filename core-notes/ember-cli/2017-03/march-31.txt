## Discussion Notes

### Glimmer Pipeline

Extract `lib/broccoli/ember-app.js` into a separate npm package.

### Tree Shaking

- given list of file entries + module information + roots, generate a retained graph
- keep module loose w/o concat until the very end
- generate dep graph at the very end of the build process
- have a hook that will give you access to dep graph w/o being able to modify it

### `app.import` from `node_modules`

- support amd, cjs or es6 w/o watching
- everything that's imported is considered dynamically linked
- should care about single file (entry point) make sure we can tell the difference between globals/modules for tree shaking (globals and module are in different buckets)
- need to be able to "blacklist" modules to resolve them during runtime
  - possibly make it automatic, we *should* have info already or do a dep walk on app.import path
  - should *not* require for users to pass into list of modules when using `app.import`
- address differences between `import`s (documentation or otherwise)
  - `app.import` is project relative
  - `this.import` is relative to whatever `this` is
- path *has* to start with `vendor`, `node_modules`

### Blrpnt extraction

- unfork
  - port new test changes from ember-cli
  - make sure we haven't lost anything added in ember-cli/blueprint.js
- load blprnt in ember-cli
  - bring into ember-cli as drop in replacement
- decouple pods/classic structures information from blprint/blueprint.js
  - create new structures using new primitive to manage this logic in ember-cli
- create module unification structure to provide blueprint support
  - use glimmer resolver to take advantage of rules to generate file paths

### Background Service

**idea 1**: Convert bin/cli into an actor system to provide parallelism  (actor === task)

**idea 2**: Daemonize the process

- removing add-ons (packages.json changes) needs to restart daemon
- daemon per application
- abstraction at app layer

*Conclusion*: Since the gain of this refactor doesn't seem high enough
at this point we will not move forward with those plans.

### Slow Commands

#### `generate`:

- idea 1: cache the project property that gets passed in, which is probably the biggest slowdown
- idea 2: based on ember-cli version, add-on commands will use a shim for `includedCommands`
  to export a hash with keys being the command name, and value being a hash including the path
  to the module to be required, as well as command options and any other relevant info
  - the primary issue comes from requires at the top of the command
- deprecate command name property, in favor of the key

#### `help`

- upon add-on install, identify and write an add-on's available blueprint g -h json
  output to a per project file like `.ember-cli-help`  or something similar
- `ember -h` would parse that generated json file and generate the terminal output

### Ember CLI/Broccoli Errors

Currently, our error handling in ember cli is very rudimentary (e.g. Template Compilation errors
when all that uses see is confusing message from Glimmer internals). There were previous [efforts](https://github.com/ember-cli/broccoli-middleware/pull/4) to outline what it might look like ideally.

This would require:

- changes to handlebars compiler itself (it has error information already, just doesn't propagate it up);
- changes to ember-template-compiler
- changes to glimmer
- changes to broccoli-middleware
- changes to broccoli-builder (this one is interesting b/c we diverged from the mainstream version;
  mainstream version does some work to expose error information already; elephant in the room is should
  be un-fork and start using mainstream one or just keep using the fork)
- creating a package that would unify error information across projects mentioned above,
  a.k.a `new BroccoliError(/*some args*/)`
- some design work to make it nice
- might be nice to follow a pattern similar to mocha assertions, where we attach more helpful properties
  onto errors, such as fullStack and humanized stack. That way we can provide both or either
  (depending on the UI)
- profit?

### Global Add-ons

- needs an RFC
- save global add-ons in user home folder (like `.ember-cli`)
- each global add-on likely needs to explicitly declare its CLI version compatibility through
  a semver constraint in the `package.json`. That way CLI could list all the global add-ons
  it can see and figure out which ones to load by comparing the constraints against its own
  version and potentially display a warning message that some global add-on wasn't loaded
  due to that.

### `lib-cli`

*Conclusion*: seems like a low priority at the moment. The project is moving towards being more generic.
In order for this effort to be successful, we would like need an external client (i.e. `angular-cli`).
