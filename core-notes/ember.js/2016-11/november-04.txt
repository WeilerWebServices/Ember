### Minutes

#### RFC #50, assert stripping

RJ: Basically the same as what we do in Ember

(some discussion, outcome in: https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/50#issuecomment-258503562)

#### Needs Team Discussion GG Label

KS: I worry issues go here to die. There is an issue where we removed some private API. I didn't think it raised to the level of "intimate API", but it needs discussion.

SP: This is a discussion about the challenge in general though

KS: Yes I want to know what the process is here.

TD: I think these issues can often need a champion to advance

SP: So in this case kris would be the champion to discuss this item

YK: I think needs team response is useful, and needs team discussion is a good second level. needs team discussion needs a conceptually untriaged state.

KS: If any of us reviews an issue we should at least comment that we were there and looked at the issue.

SP: I think that is good messaging on the issue as well.

#### Module RFC

RJ: I have some comments, but this is well done and you should submit it so we can discuss.

TD: I want to be sure we have consensus b/c it will be unproductive to have significant divergence of opinion on the actual RFC thread.
